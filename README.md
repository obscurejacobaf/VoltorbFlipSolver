# VoltorbFlipSolver
Designed to automatically solve the voltorb flip game in pokemon infinite fusion, over and over again. Leave it running over night and max out you coin case.

## TODO:
1. Allow pausing program.
2. Deal with the lack of a message when losing but not moving down a level. (Issue is we mark the top left tile when not intended.)

## FAQ
* Does this work on Mac/Linux/My Toaster?
  * Nope, it uses the windows API for interacting with pokemon infinite fusion.
* Does this work with {my resolution here}?
  * Unless you are running in fullscreen 1920(or greater) by 1440, then I haven't tested it. Maybe, I did make the calculations dynamic, but it's rather picky.
* How do I run this?
  * Don't. Use Visual Studio or shutting it down will be an issue.
